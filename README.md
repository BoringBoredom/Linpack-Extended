Linpack Extended is a stress test for 64-bit Intel processors. It is based on the [Intel Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mkl-benchmarks-suite.html).

### Features
- chain different problem sizes with different settings (time to run, leading dimension, alignment value and library version)
- track Min/Avg/Max GFlops per problem size
- optionally stop test when residuals mismatch
- optionally disable command line output to reduce unnecessary resource usage at lower problem sizes
